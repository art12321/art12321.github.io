My name is Arthur Wood. Here are some things about me:

- I am a Mechanical Engineering Student at SJSU.
- I love working on projects and creating stuff.

What else do you need?

### My story

I was born in France, but lived all my life in the states. I have lived in the midwest, central plains, and on the pacific coast. I keep pretty busy with my studies but when I have time I am working on a ton of projects to further understand the world around me.
